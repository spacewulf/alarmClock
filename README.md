# Alarm Clock App

I've been annoyed with most of the default and popular alarm clocks on android specifically, as I'm an incredibly deep sleeper, and none of the currently available options do well enough to consistently wake me up. The goal of this is to have more complex systems of turning off the alarm, so I stop sleeping through classes.
